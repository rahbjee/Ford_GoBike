# Ford_GoBike
Analyzing Ford GoBike from the second half of 2017 in the SF Bay area

This analysis was conducted using Python and various imported packaged including pandas, geopandas, folium, and matplotlib.  I've included all of my thoughts alongside my code (and corresponding comments) in an interactive Python notebook labeled DFord_HW-v2.ipynb.
