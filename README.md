# Ford_GoBike
Analyzing Ford GoBike from the second half of 2017 in the SF Bay area

This analysis was conducted using Python and various imported packaged including pandas, geopandas, folium, and matplotlib.  I've included all of my thoughts alongside my code (and corresponding comments) in an interactive Python notebook labeled DFord_HW-v2.ipynb.  The best way to view this notebook is using the nbviewer at this URL: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rahbjee/Ford_GoBike/blob/main/DFord_HW-v2.ipynb

If you would like to spin up this analysis on your local computer, you will need to download all of the files, install the required python packages (listed above & also including datetime and numpy if applicable), then run the jupyter notebook command to view the analysis in the DFord_HW-v2.ipynb notebook. Please note that the folium maps are not being displayed in github, however they can be viewed with the nbviewer link above & they should also work if properly downloaded & installed on your local machine.

Thanks for stopping by to view my analysis of this bike-share program!
